# Bioinformatics Portfolio – Samuel Rice

#### Welcome to my portfolio summary!

I'm a Master's-level bioinformatician with a strong foundation in multi-omics analysis, machine learning, and computational biology. This repository highlights key projects demonstrating my ability to analyse, model, and interpret complex biological data using cutting-edge tools and techniques.

I pride myself on being a hard worker with a curiosity to learn new skills and software, especially in modelling, programming, and problem-solving.

This portfolio summarises skills and abilities backed by my projects and experience.

## Languages
* Python
* R
* MATLAB
* BASH/Linux



## Project Highlights
### Multi-Omics Research – Streptomyces Strain Interactions
Integrated transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and metabolomics (MS1) to identify inhibitory interactions relevant to sustainable crop protection

Applied DESeq2, PathIntegrate, ipaPy2, KEGG enrichment, and custom pathway modelling

### Machine Learning in Cancer Classification
Built supervised and unsupervised models (k-NN, SVM, LDA, clustering) using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset

Applied PCA, cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature scaling with scikit-learn

### Spatial & Single-Cell Transcriptomics – Glioblastoma Subtypes
Used Seurat, PCA, clustering, and STRING database to identify cell-type-specific markers and subtype-specific spatial profiles

### GWAS & PRS Modelling – Blood Pressure Regulation
Used PLINK to compute polygenic risk scores with LD clumping and thresholding for hypertension risk stratification

### Phylogenetics – H5N1 soonotic Potential
Built maximum likelihood trees with MEGA-X and ClustalW to explore cross-species viral transmission

### Metabolomics – Hypoxic Neuroblastoma
Analysed NMR metabolomics data under hypoxic vs normoxic conditions

Performed VIP scoring, PCA, and PLS-DA using MetaboAnalyst

### Proteomics – SARS-CoV-2 Phosphorylation Profiling
Processed MS data with Comet and Lorikeet; analysed phosphosites using DAVID and STRING for pathway disruption insights

### PK/PD Modelling – Drug Absorption & Tumour Growth
Simulated pharmacokinetics in MATLAB using 1- and 2-compartment models to predict drug efficacy on tumour response

### AMR Genomics – E. coli / Shigella Comparative Analysis
Conducted pangenome and resistance gene profiling using Panaroo, RGI, ColabFold, and PyMOL to model AcrR divergence

### Phage Biology – Wolbachia & Non-Coding RNA HGT
Investigated phage WO-mediated gene transfer using BLASTn/p, Rfam, iTOL, and genomic context mapping

## About Me
I’m passionate about applying bioinformatics to real-world challenges in health, sustainability, and microbial ecology. I bring a strong mix of analytical thinking, programming proficiency, and biological insight, backed by research-grade project experience and scientific communication skills.
